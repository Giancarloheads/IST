                                        Grades 1-5 students with limited English language proficiency receive a combination of ‘pull-out’ and ‘push-in’ learning support depending on their level of proficiency, as determined by WIDA assessment programme.

                                        Pull Out Support: Students with lower levels of proficiency are pulled out of mainstream classes for up to 2 lessons per day for foundational language support during the mainstream language and literacy time.

                                        Push In Support: Students with lower levels of proficiency are also supported by ELA teachers in the mainstream classroom context. Those students who have developed a reasonable degree of language proficiency but who still require support to fully access the curriculum continue to receive push in (or ‘in-class’) support. These students may occasionally be pulled out for specific content support.

                                        ELA in secondary is aligned with the MYP and DP English Language Acquisition courses. Each student’s English language proficiency is determined using the WIDA assessment programme. ELA students in Grades 6-9 are placed into one of three different classes in accordance with their phase of proficiency. ELA students in grade 10 will be placed in two groups. When students have a strong enough English level to exit the ELA program, they are placed in English Language and Literature.

                            We believe all students have the right to participate fully in our academic and social programs. Our I.N. program support students who need special support to participate in the school’s programs. Support is based on the students’ needs, and may consist of support within the classroom, through small group instruction or modifications made by the teacher. Students may be withdrawn from their classroom for small group instruction but the majority of their time is spent with their peers in the regular classroom.

                                        Grades 1-5 students with limited English language proficiency receive a combination of ‘pull-out’ and ‘push-in’ learning support depending on their level of proficiency, as determined by WIDA assessment programme.

                                        Pull Out Support: Students with lower levels of proficiency are pulled out of mainstream classes for up to 2 lessons per day for foundational language support during the mainstream language and literacy time.

                                        Push In Support: Students with lower levels of proficiency are also supported by ELA teachers in the mainstream classroom context. Those students who have developed a reasonable degree of language proficiency but who still require support to fully access the curriculum continue to receive push in (or ‘in-class’) support. These students may occasionally be pulled out for specific content support.

                                        ELA in secondary is aligned with the MYP and DP English Language Acquisition courses. Each student’s English language proficiency is determined using the WIDA assessment programme. ELA students in Grades 6-9 are placed into one of three different classes in accordance with their phase of proficiency. ELA students in grade 10 will be placed in two groups. When students have a strong enough English level to exit the ELA program, they are placed in English Language and Literature.

                                        ELA students also attend the Humanities for English as an Additional Language (HEAL) course, which runs parallel with the mainstream Humanities course but are taught by the ELA teachers.
